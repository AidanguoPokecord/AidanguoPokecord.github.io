        <h1>Travis Scott and the Sneaker Culture.</h1>
        <img src="images/Sksksk.jpeg">
        <h3 class ="sysy">Rappers are the new athletes in the sneaker world when it comes to moving product. Names like LeBron James
            and Zion Williamson can still turn heads, but the paradigm has clearly shifted
            in the marketplace. Success from names like Kanye West and Pharrell are obvious examples, but there arguably
            isn’t a bigger draw in sneakers right now than Travis Scott.
            The rapper experienced a meteoric rise in mainstream popularity over the past year, thanks in large part to
            his massively successful third studio album, Astroworld. Despite no official signature sneaker to speak of
            like the aforementioned names, Nike has let Scott put his spin on various silhouettes ranging from Air Force
            1s to Air Jordan IVs. Not everyone can say they’ve been able to play with the branding on one of the most
            iconic shoes ever made, or stamp their personal logo in place of a Jumpman. He has gotten to do both.

            The craziest part is that there doesn’t seem to be any signs of him slowing down any time soon. The
            28-year-old has five retail releases under his belt in a little over two years with countless other
            exclusive offerings that have surfaced along the way. His name holds so much weight nowadays that Nike has
            even tried to drum up hype for some of its newer silhouettes using his co-sign, the best example being the
            Air Jordan 33 that released this past February. Travis Scott has become Nikes Kanye. Outperforming more standard artists like Virgil Abloh and Off White.</h3>
